# Calculator
Pretty simple calculator


The extra credit stuff broke my calculator, it worked within about a day which is really good and means I have progressed a lot.
Make Some changes:
1. The calculator adds numbers to the 2nd num after hitting equal instead of adding to the solution(aka num1)
2. Decimals are a slight bit wonky, fix the few bugs
